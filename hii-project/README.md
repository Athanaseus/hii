# Hii Project

Welcome to the Hii Project! This project is designed to create a GitHub website that showcases various images and their properties through a catalog.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for deploying the website.
- **assets/images/placeholder.png**: A placeholder image that will be replaced with actual images later.
- **catalog.csv**: A catalog file that lists the properties of the sources. The column names correspond to the names of the PNG files used in the project.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that displays the content based on the catalog and references the images.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hii-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd hii-project
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the project.

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for deployment. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the website will be automatically built and deployed. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

## Adding Images

You can add your images to the `assets/images` directory. Make sure the names of the images correspond to the column names in the `catalog.csv` file.
