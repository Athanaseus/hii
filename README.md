# Hii Project

Welcome to the Hii! This project is designed to create a GitHub website that showcases various images and their properties through a catalog.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **.github/workflows/deploy.yml**: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for deploying the website.
- **assets/images/**: A directory to upload images that will be displayed on the website.
- **catalog.csv**: A catalog file that lists the properties of the sources. The column names correspond to the names of the PNG files used in the project.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that displays the content based on the catalog and references the images.

## Adding Images

You can add your images to the `assets/images` directory. Make sure the names of the images correspond to the column names in the `catalog.csv` file.
